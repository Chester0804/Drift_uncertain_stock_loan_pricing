# Drift_uncertain_stock_loan_pricing
This is my capstone project under the supervision of Prof Xu Zuoquan. The report is based on Prof Xu's paper on drift uncertain stock loan model.

I implemented the regressioned-based Monte Carlo simulation to price the stock loan under drift uncertain. Of course, one can try to solve the PDE derived from dynamic programming principle by other numerical methods such as finite difference method.
